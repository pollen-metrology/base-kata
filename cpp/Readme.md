# Kata base project for C++
This base project will allow to build a Kata environment for C++.
It provides following files:
* init.bat      : A script to automate C++ project build for Visual Studio
* Launcher.cpp  : A simple file, which contain the `main()` function. No 'active' code is expected here.
* Library.cpp   : Where to implement 'active' Kata code
* Tests.cpp     : Where to implement the unit tests, using Google Test API
